# Investigation of the use symbolic regression in data analysis

In regression some data is fitted to a model function.
An example of linear regression is where some data is fit to
a straight line model

$$y = m x + c$$

where m and c are parameters that are determined from the data

However, many possible complex models are possible.
For example, there could more complex models, for example
there could be a quadratic term.


$$y = a  x^2 + m x + c $$

with fit parameters a,m and c.

There are many more possible fit models such as involving log
or exponential functions. Sometimes physical insight allows
some insight into the correct model.

Symbolic regression is a method to determine the model from
data. Essentially it is way of searching through the many different
possible models.
