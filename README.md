# Investigation of the use symbolic regression in data analysis

In regression some data is fitted to a model function.
An example of linear regression is where some data is fit to
a straight line model

y = m*x + c

where m and c are parameters. 

However, for many possible complex models are possible.
For example, there could more complex models, for example
there could be a quadratic term.


$$y = a  x^2 + m x + c $$

with fit parameters a,m and c.

There are many more possible fit models such as involving log
or exponential functions.

Symbolic regression is a method to determine the model from
data.
